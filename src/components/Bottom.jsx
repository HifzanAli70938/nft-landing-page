While the universe expands, our brand grows, and collectors can expect exclusive access to the latest products, merchandise and events through ownership.
      Owning a FOMO Charlie allows you to vote on community-driven features, products and events. This makes our roadmap collaborative to be decided by the project founders and FOMO Charlie holders. Our community treasury is used to fund these experiences.
